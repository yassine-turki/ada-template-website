### Introduction

(some AI generated photo?)
My name is Angelina, I am 21 years old and I just finished a school of theater in Paris. Theater has always been my passion, but the problem is the very low and unreliable salary. My dream now is to work in the movie industry where I will be able to continue acting, while earning a sufficient income.  
A friend of mine told me: “Movies are made by men for men. Women are just here to add sexyness”. 

It struck me, as I never could imagine such a strong statement could be true. In this era of fake news, I could not let my dreams be ruined by a few words so I decided to take the matter in my own hands. I decided to pursue a class at EPFL called ADA, and do my own analysis of all the movie industry. Then, and only then, I will be able to determine whether my friend was right or not. 

##Starting from the beginning

I went on the internet and downloaded the information of all movies from wikipedia. At first glance I wanted to see the ratio of actresses and actors. I found out that there are [...] more men than women. I was a little disoriented. But since I am in Paris, I checked the ratio in France. I also took the opportunity to look at various countries. Figure … shows the ratio of actors vs actresses by world region. 
…

I was disappointed to see that women are much less present than men. But I did not lose hope, and figured that perhaps there was a great evolution of women in films. So I looked at the evolution of the percentage of women in films (figure…) globally but also by regions (figure…)

…
The proportion of women in films globally increased a tiny bit by the end of the 20th century. In France, it increased by …, while in …, it only increased by ….
One thing I learned from ADA is that valuable information can be hidden in the data so I decided to dig further and look at the evolution of actresses in film by movie genre. Figure … shows the share of women in the movie industry by genre, and figure… shows the evolution of women in those genres. 

…

Looking at [movie genre] definitely does not seem very attractive as they are only [share of women]. However, [movie genre] seems already a bit more favorable for women. It’s not really my type though.
