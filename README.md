### Introduction

(some AI generated photo?)
My name is Angelina, I am 21 years old and I just finished a school of theater in Paris. Theater has always been my passion, but the problem is the very low and unreliable salary. My dream now is to work in the movie industry where I will be able to continue acting, while earning a sufficient income.  
A friend of mine told me: “Movies are made by men for men. Women are just here to add sexyness”. 

It struck me, as I never could imagine such a strong statement could be true. In this era of fake news, I could not let my dreams be ruined by a few words so I decided to take the matter in my own hands. I decided to pursue a class at EPFL called ADA, and do my own analysis of all the movie industry. Then, and only then, I will be able to determine whether my friend was right or not.
